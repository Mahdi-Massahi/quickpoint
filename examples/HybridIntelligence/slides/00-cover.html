    <p>This session is about "Hybrid Intelligence".</p>
    <p>I won't share any rules of thumb, tips or tricks. My goal in this talk is to share my mindset with you. And unfortunately to get there we need to go through some theories, I've done my best to make the theory engaging! Once we all get there and make sure we are on the same page, I will give you a few examples to show you how one can materialise what we'll talk about.</p>
    <p>During the session you'll see the stack under the slide title, follow it to not to get lost!</p>
    <p>Don't worry if you missed the flow, it might be a bit "complex"; however I will share the slides on my LinkedIn :)</p>
    <p>Well as I said, this talk is about Hybrid Intelligence. To understand what it is, we first need to break it down and understand the pieces; Hybrid and Intelligence. Let's start with Intelligence.</p>
